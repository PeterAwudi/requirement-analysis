## What is Requirement Analysis? 🤔

Requirement Analysis is the process of understanding what a software system should do before any coding begins. 📝 It involves gathering detailed information from clients, users, or stakeholders to know exactly what they need the software to achieve. 🎯

## Importance in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) 📈

Requirement Analysis is a key step in the SDLC because:

- *Clarity 🔍*: It helps everyone understand the goal of the software.  
- *Planning 📅*: It helps developers plan how much time and resources will be needed.  
- *Avoids Mistakes 🚫*: It prevents developers from building the wrong features.  
- *Saves Money 💸*: Finding mistakes early (during planning) is cheaper than fixing them later.  
- *Improves Quality 💯*: When requirements are clear, the final product is more likely to meet user expectations.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis plays a crucial role in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). It helps ensure that the software being built truly meets the needs of its users and avoids costly mistakes. Below are three key reasons why this step is essential:

### 1. Prevents Misunderstandings
Without clear requirements, developers may build something entirely different from what the client expects. Requirement Analysis ensures that all stakeholders—developers, clients, and users—are on the same page from the beginning.

### 2. Saves Time and Cost
Identifying problems or missing features at the planning stage is far less expensive than fixing them after development. Proper analysis helps avoid rework and delays by setting clear expectations early on.

### 3. Improves Software Quality
When developers understand exactly what the system should do, they can build it more effectively. This leads to fewer bugs, better performance, and higher user satisfaction.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis 📝

1. *Requirement Gathering 📊*: Collecting all possible requirements from clients, users, and stakeholders.  
2. *Requirement Elicitation 💬*: Drawing out more details from stakeholders to clarify unclear points.  
3. *Requirement Documentation 📝*: Writing down all collected and clarified requirements in a clear, organized manner.  
4. *Requirement Analysis and Modeling 📊*: Analyzing requirements to understand how they fit together and modeling them using diagrams or structured formats.  
5. *Requirement Validation 📝*: Reviewing and confirming requirements with stakeholders to ensure they are complete, accurate, and agreed upon.

## Types of Requirements 📝

1. *Functional Requirements 📊*: Defining the specific behavior or functions of a system.  
2. *Non-functional Requirements 📈*: Specifying the quality attributes of a system.

## Use Case Diagrams 📊

A Use Case Diagram is a visual representation of the interactions between users (called actors) and the system to achieve specific goals. 🎯

## Acceptance Criteria 📝

Acceptance Criteria are a set of predefined requirements that must be met for a feature or functionality to be considered complete and accepted by the end user or client. 📊

### Example: Checkout Feature – Acceptance Criteria 🛍

1. The user must be able to view a summary of their booking before proceeding to payment. 📝  
2. The system should validate all payment inputs (e.g., card number, expiry date) before processing. 📊  
3. The checkout process must redirect the user to a secure payment gateway. 🔒  
4. The user receives a booking confirmation via email upon successful payment. 📧  
5. If payment fails, the user must see an error message and be given the option to retry or choose another payment method. 🚫
